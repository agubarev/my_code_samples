This is my code. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My code is my best tool. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my code is useless. Without my code, I am useless. I must write my code true. I must code cleaner than my enemy, who is trying to outperform me. I must outcode him before he outcodes me. I will. Before God, I swear this creed: my code and I are defenders of my project, we are the masters of our enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until victory is mine and there are no bugs, but peace!
